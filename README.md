# SQL Evaluation System

Simple evaluation program that allows a **trainer** user to create quizzes and **student** user to practice and
answer evaluations. Users who are not logged in can also practice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Design Decisions

We created this program using the MVC model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Configuration

You must run the _sql skills fall2019.sql_ file in mysql before being able to use the application.
Also run the _avions-create.sql_ and _banque-create-mysql.sql_ .
